# PHP Secret Santa #
A simple online PHP Secret Santa Appliction. Forked from thybag, sprinkled with additional touches for the "Foi o Destino que os uniu, mas agora p#7@ que o pariu!" Facebook group by r0ckf3l3r.

To deploy the PHP Secret Santa Application on to your own PHP Enabled webhost, simply upload the index.php and SecretSanta.class.php files in to be web accessible directory on your site.

Its recommended that you update the "from" address used in the tool by changing the value on line 45 of index.php to use an email address relevant to your site.

    $santa->setFrom('Name of Sender','email_of_sender@yoursite.com');

If you'd like to integrate PHP Secret Santa with an existing system (or simply use your own front end), the SecretSanta.class.php is easy to interact with.

A basic example of SecretSanta.class.php's usage is:

    $santa = new SecretSanta();
    $santa->run(
        array(
            array('name'=>'Bob', 'email'=> 'bob@bobnet.sample'),
            array('name'=>'Dave Daveworth', 'email'=> 'dave@davenet.sample')
        )
    );
